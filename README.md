<h1>Insurance-Claim-Insights-and-Analysis</h1>
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze insurance policy, claim, and customer data for performance tracking, business insights, and strategic decision-making.
<br><br>
The Insurance Claim Insights Dashboard provides a comprehensive visual analysis of insurance policies, claim performance, and customer demographics. It enables stakeholders to monitor claim trends, assess policy performance, and identify areas for improvement in claim settlement and customer engagement.

<h1>Tech Stack</h1><br>
  
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization and reporting platform.

• 📂 Power Query – Used for data extraction, transformation, and cleaning from raw CSV files.

• 🗂️ Data Modeling – Established relationships between policy, claim, and customer tables for interactive cross-filtering and analytics.

• 📁 Data Source Format – Excel/CSV files imported into Power BI for transformation and visualization.

<h1>Data Format</h1>
Insurance data in Excel CSV format.

The dataset includes details of:

• Policy and Claim Information (Policy Number, Claim Number, Claim Amount, Coverage Amount)

• Customer Demographics (Gender, Age Group)

• Policy Types (Auto, Health, Home, Life, Travel)

• Claim Status (Pending, Rejected, Settled)

• Active and Inactive Policy counts

<h1>Features</h1>
• Business Problem Insurance companies often manage large volumes of data across multiple policy types and claim statuses. Without clear visualization, it’s challenging to identify which policies perform best, how claims are distributed, and where delays or rejections occur.
<br><br>

<br><br>
1.Tracks premium collection, claim amounts, and coverage value.<br>
2.Analyzes policy performance by type and status.<br>
3.Highlights demographic insights like gender distribution and age-group claim behavior.<br>
4.Supports business decisions in risk management, underwriting, and claim processing.<br>
